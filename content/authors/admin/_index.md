I am a Technical Product Manager @ Oracle where I work on building AI and ML powered products that enable Financial Institutions to better prevent and detect Money Laundering and thus make our financial system safer. 

I am a data scientist, a newbie product manager and an infinite learner constantly seeking to become wiser every single day.
