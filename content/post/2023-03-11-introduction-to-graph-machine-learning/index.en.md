One of the initiatives I am most proud of in my current role is the Monthly Learning Hour. Every Month, each person in my team takes turns to do an hour long presentation on a topic of interest. Most recently, I did a session on Graph Machine Learning.

You can access the full notebook on Google Colab [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/govindgnair23/Graph-Machine-Learning/blob/master/Intro_to_Graph_Machine_Learning.ipynb).

The notebook covers some interesting algorithms that have emerged in the field between 1998(Page Rank) and 2017(Graph Attention Networks). It also demonstrated how to use them on real datasets with Network X and Pytorch geometric. I am working on a video walk through of the notebook as some parts of it can be quite dense. Check out references at the bottom of the notebook to learn more.
