When you own a small business, learning how to successfully manage your schedule and productivity is vital. If you’ve mastered these skills, it may be time to put them to good use in your personal life. That’s because most of the tools and tactics you use will translate well. To help you out, here are a few examples and how to use them to create more balance. 

## Asking for Help

This is such a big one! But learning how to ask for help can make running your business and life so much easier. After all, no one person is an island — we all need a little help from time to time, whether that help comes from other people or from tech tools and services like an online [formation service](https://www.zenbusiness.com/new-york-llc/). 

Let’s talk about that last one first. Forming an LLC can be beneficial for freelancers and small business owners. An LLC will protect your personal assets and set you up for tax savings. Using an online formation service instead of figuring out the paperwork yourself will save you time. It will also help save you money since you can forego costly fees of working with an attorney. 

Tools that save you time are amazing! But knowing when to ask for help from other people in your professional and personal life is also important. One example is hiring help around your home. For example, hiring [cleaning help](https://www.urdesignmag.com/lifestyle/2019/06/06/the-benefits-to-hiring-a-house-cleaning-service-when-you-have-a-family/) can save time and your sanity if you have a family. 

## Embracing Change

To manage tasks for your small business, you need to be flexible. Things can change at a moment’s notice, including the needs of your business. As one example, [tech needs](https://www.govindgnair.com/post/crossing-the-chasm/) for businesses and consumers are always evolving, and how those changes are handled can be one of the keys to success. You also need to be able to adapt how you market innovation. 

In terms of your personal life, you can think of embracing innovation as building resiliency. If you’re used to riding the tides of change in your business, you can apply this same [mindset](https://www.apa.org/topics/resilience) to your personal life. As a result, you’ll start to feel less stressed and affected by the unexpected. 

One of the best ways to boost resilience is to take better care of yourself. Making time for self-care routines — like getting exercise, eating healthy and connecting with others — is good for your physical and mental health. [Practicing more](https://www.godaddy.com/garage/self-care-tips-entrepreneurs/) self-care can also be good for your business — not to mention that self-care will add years to your life for you to enjoy the fruits of your labor.

## Improving Productivity

You can’t think about task management without thinking about productivity. Chances are, you already have [a few tricks](https://www.ringcentral.com/us/en/blog/productivity-tools/) up your sleeve to help maximize your productivity levels. Those tricks may include tech tools and apps like Google Drive, Trello and Evernote. If you already know how to use these productivity boosters, you can always try applying them to your personal life. You can simply keep separate folders or even set up [separate accounts](https://www.getapp.com/resources/reasons-more-than-one-email/) to maintain work-life balance. There are also apps dedicated to managing your personal schedule. 

For busy parents with kids and packed schedules, [highly rated](https://www.hgtv.com/design/remodel/interior-remodel/10-apps-to-help-organize-family-schedules-pictures) organizing apps can help tame the chaos. Cozi is a great all-in-one app that syncs your schedules, helps you plan meals, and also makes grocery shopping a snap. There are other options, too, so be sure to explore them. 

If you can manage your business, there’s no reason why you can’t manage your personal life. In fact, you can achieve both at the same time and achieve more balance in the process. Try applying some of the same tools and strategies you use professionally, and then look for more specific ways to maximize your time and, ultimately, maximize your satisfaction with life.
